"""Example code for a PyQt image-display widget which Just Worksâ„¢

TODO: Split this into a loader wrapper and a widget wrapper so it can be used
      in designs which maintain a preloaded queue of upcoming images to improve
      the perception of quick load times.
      reworke adaptScale() so they have the same type signature.

Note from HeleleMama:
    Based on Stephan Sokolow's work, I did the following:
    1) re-arrange his structure to make things clearer.
    2) Fix wrong image size while reloading image/Fix GIF flicker while loading
    3) add adjustSize(), which performs like QLabel.adjustSize()
    4) inherit from QLabel directly

    - Animated GIFs will animate, like in a browser, by transparently switching

    - Content will scale up or down to fit the widget while preserving its
      aspect ratio and will do so without imposing a minimum size of 100%.
    - Letterbox/pillarbox borders will default to transparent.
      (It's a bit of a toss-up whether an application will want this or the
       default window background colour, so this defaults to the choice that
       provides an example of how to accomplish it.)

    Note that QImageReader doesn't have an equivalent to GdkPixbufLoader's
    `area-prepared` and `area-updated` signals, so incremental display for
    for high-speed scanning (ie. hitting "next" based on a partially loaded
    images) isn't really possible. The closest one can get is to experiment
    with QImageReader's support for loading just part of a JPEG file to see if
    it can be done without significantly adding to the whole-image load time.
